Hello, thank you for being interested in my "**Web RQ**" package. With this tool you can get data from sites like Facebook & Google Trends without much effort, as long as we have the module, of course.
The purpose of this tool is the easy collection of data from various sites on the Web and with the possibility of "translation" and also the creation of new modules for it.
Make good use and **stay legal**, please.


## How to use
All tutorials will be available on the [Wiki](https://github.com/backtobasicsdatabrazil/Web-RQ/wiki), if not, consider opening a request.

## Special thanks

Soon here will be the name and link of all the creators of the packages used.


#### Attention: The tool is still in development, it is not recommended to professional use
